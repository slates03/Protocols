# For extraction of RNA from bee tissue - Brock Harpur

1. Mash tissue with a pestle in 500 ul Trizol
2. Wash pestle with additional 500 ul Trizol 
3. Mix tube by inversion
4. Add 200 ul chloroform
5. Shake for 15s, incubate 5 minutes @ room temp
6. Spin 14K for 15 minutes on highest
7. Upper layer to new tube (record volume)
8. Add 4 ul linear acrylamide
9. Add equal volume of 2-propanol, shake, incubate 10 minutes  
10. Spin @ 4C 10 minutes on highest
11. Remove liquid by pouring. Get all of it with a pipette and additional spins. Careful of the pellet. You want to dry this as much as possible. 
12. Wash with 1mL 70% ETOH
13. Spin @ 4C 10 minutes
14. Remove ETOH
15. Re-suspend in 20-100 ul DEPC-treated H2O (if cleaning, I use 81 ul)

# To clean:

16. Add equal volume of 100% ETOH 
17. Add to Quiagen RNEASY column
18. 500ul RW1, spin @7800 for 15 seconds (15 second spin = 15ss)
19. Add 10ul DNASE into 70ul RDD then add this 80ul to the column. Ensure complete coverage of the filter and edges. Note: make a master batch if doing large numbers of samples
20. Incubate for 15 minutes @RT
21. Add 350 ul RW1 15ss, remove flow through
22. Add 500ul RPE 15ss, remove flow through
23. Add 500ul RPE 15ss, remove flow through
24. Dry the sample completely (15ss)
25. Add new tube to bottom and add 30-50ul warm DEPC-treated H2O. Let sit for a few minutes then 15ss
