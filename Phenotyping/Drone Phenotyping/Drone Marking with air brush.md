# Air brush protocol and tips

1. The airbrush and associated materials should be kept together in their tupperware container with painting supplies. Wear gloves if possible and wear clothes that you do not mind getting paint on. 
2. Set up the airbrush and compressor outdoors or in a very well ventilated space. Do NOT use the airbrush in the lab space. Even using it in the tool room can be dangerous. 
3. Ensure the hoses are connected to the gun and compressor. Turn the compressor on. It will only activate (e.g. make sound) when the air pressure is below that needed to operate the gun. 
4. Add ~1ml of paint thinner to the gun reservoir. The cap of the reservoir pops on and off and does not need to be on the gun when in use. Run the thinner through the gun to ensure it is clean. Press the trigger to start air flow and pull the trigger back to increase or decrease the amount being sprayed. If the gun is clogged or if there is paint coming out, clean the gun with the cleaners provided and with paint thinner. 
5. When the gun is clean, prepare your paints. Dilute your paint with paint thinner to the consistency of milk in a falcon tube. Break up any chunks. Use a disposable eye dropper to add dilute paint to the gun reservoir (~1ml is plenty). The cap of the reservoir pops on and off and does not need to be on the gun when in use. 
6. Test the paint flow on a piece of paper or cardboard before painting bees. Adjust your distance as needed to ensure an even, THIN layer is being sprayed. Move your entire arm back and forth across a surface to get an even coating of paint. Try not to move your wrist as this will create light and heavy spots in your painting. 
7. Once you’re comfortable, move to spray your bees. 
8. Once complete with one color, remove excess paint from the reservoir with a disposable eye dropper or syringe. Add paint thinner to the reservoir and clean thoroughly. This can be disposed of in a waste falcon tube. Remove ALL paint from inside the gun. Use pipe cleaners where necessary. You should also spray paint thinner through the gun to ensure it is clean inside. Remove and clean the tip in paint thinner. There should be no paint on or in the gun when you’re finished. 

**Additional tips:**
If you want to practice, fill the gun with ddH2O.
