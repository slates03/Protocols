# Sperm Phenotyping Protocol
## Sperm Extraction

1. Sexually mature drones were stimulated to ejaculate by pressing on the thorax and/or removing the head. This usually resulted in partial eversion of the penis. Furthure pressure on the abdomen forced hemolymph to the penis and complete the process.
2. The cream colored semen and a white mucus plug were released to the end of the penis. Under a disseciting microscope, 2.5x, semen was collected without mucus into a syringe.
3. The syringe was composed of a tip (made from a capillary pipette drawn to a fine point, 0.17-0.21 mm ID), a collection tube (capillary tubesof varioussizes), and 0.12” ID tubing tilled with 3%NaCl solution connected in that sequence to a 0.2 ml. micrometer syringe(Gilmont Instruments, BarringtonIL 60010).
4. The hydraulic system thus created readily drew up the small quantity,<l uL,of semen from each drone and allowed for a pooled collection from many drones.

## Sperm Concentration
### Neubauers Heaemocytometer

**Loading**
1. Place the tip of the pipette in the V-shaped groove on the haemocytometer to load the chamber with sperm sample (about 15 μL). 2. Fluid is drawn into the chamber because of the capillary action
3. Never overload the chamber, as doing so will lead to an inaccurate count.
4. Inaccurate results may also be produced if the coverslip is moved after loading of the sample
5. Allow to settle for 2 or 3 min so that cells stop drifting around the chamber.
6. Do not allow sample to settle too long. Overdrying will lead to settlement of cells over the grid
7. Place the NH in the incubation chamber to avoid overdrying. Alternately, place NH on horizontally laid straws within a Petri dish, which contains a moistened filter paper. 8. Overdrying can also be avoided by placing the Neubauers Heaemocytometer on a slightly damp paper towel and covering it with a plastic cup.

**Counting**
1. Count only spermatozoa with heads and tails (complete cell).
2. Count the number of heads lying within the two sides of the subunits to avoid counting cells twice under 40x
3. To avoid double counting, count only sperm heads, avoiding tails totally
4. Do not count a sperm cell when most of its head lies on the central line if that line is the upper- or right-handed line of the square.

**Calculation**
1. Allow charged NH to stay in this position for settling effect.
2. Count the number of sperm cells in four WBC chambers, i.e. top left and right and bottom left and right.
3. Count cells which lie within smaller cham-bers only.
4. Do not count sperm heads that lie outside the midline of the boundary
5. Spermconventratio(n/mL)=No. of spermatozoa counted * VCF *DF= (Number of cells in 4 squares (64 small squares)/4) * 10^4 (if depth is 0.1: 0.1*.0001) * Dilution Factor (1ul sperm/1000ul
dilution=100000 DF & 0.5 ul sperm/1000ul dilution=200000 DF )

**Considerations**
* Mix the semen sample by rotating the semen container evenly between the thumb and the forefinger; rotate it in one plane. Always draw semen up to the mark in the pipette.
* Blot out the excess semen from outside of the coverslip.
* Keep the pipette at 45° angle at one side of the coverslip while charging.
* Always wipe out side of the pipette after using it to draw semen.
* Wetting supports (rails) with water helps in keeping the coverslip in place.
* Alternately, breathing on the NH surface makes it slightly damp.
* Newton’s rings will not appear in some chambers constructed with ground glass pil-lars. Apply about 1.5 μL of water to each ground glass pillar to hold the coverslip in place. Ensure that water is not introduced into the counting area.
* While using the phase-type haemocytome-ter (the thin ones), then be sure the phase rings are in and the condenser is all the way up. You should be able to focus on the sperm, but be careful not to break the cover-slip. If you used one of the thicker haemocy-tometers, pull the phase rings out, and close down the aperture on the condenser so that you can see the sperm.
* As soon as the meniscus reaches the far side of the chamber, stop filling it.
* Ensure that the coverslip is unmoved during filling and no air bubbles are trapped under the coverslip.
* Lower or raise the condenser to increase the contrast when sperm cells are difficult to visualize.
* Presence of 20–25 cells per large square shows proper dilution of the sample.
* For accurate estimation of the sperm cell concentration, count a minimum of two chambers (including a minimum of 100 cells within each central counting area of each chamber). For greater precision, count some more sperm cells, and take the average to calculate cell concentration.
* Prepare another sample when the cells are clumped.
* Always use a positive-displacement pipette to dispense the correct quantity of fixative into dilution vials.
* Always use coverslips specifically meant for NH chambers. These coverslips are slightly thicker and are perfectly flat than regular disposable coverslips. Clean the whole assemblies of NH with DW followed by alcohol finally dry with ether after each use.

### Spectrophotometer

**Dilution Chart**

**Procedure**
1. Turn on spectrophotometer power switches at least 15 min before use.
2. Set the wavelength adjustment knob to set the red wavelength to 540 nm
3. Take 1 uL fresh semen sample and deter-mine concentration using haemocytometer.
4. Now we have 12 samples with varying dilu-tion rates (with different known cell concentrations).
5. Put 3 mL of diluting fluid in a square cuvette and place in the spectrophotometer.
6. Handle the cuvette by the frosted sides.
7. Ensure that the cuvette is properly aligned in the holder. This permits light to pass from left to right through the clear sides of the cuvette.
8. The frosted sides of the cuvette should face the front of the spectrophotometer.
9. Always push the cuvette holder selection knob in almost completely so that the first notch in the selector is engaged. This aligns the first cuvette slot with the light beam.
10. Use the dark current knob to set the meter to read 0% transmittance.
11. To open, turn the shutter knob. Transmittance is set to 100% with the slit width knob. 12. Remove cuvette and add known semen samples made as above.
13. Cover cuvette with a cap and mix five to ten times followed by wiping of the sides.
14. Place cuvette back in spectrophotometer. Ensure proper alignment of cuvette holder.
15. Note down OD once it stabilizes.
16. Measure the OD of all the 12 known samples individually.
17. Plot a graph of OD vs sperm concentration.
18. Take unknown semen sample, and by dilut-ing to a known dilution rate, find out the OD. 19. Use this value to calculate sperm concentration from the graph.

**Considerations**
* Frequently calibrate the spectrophotometer.
* Calibrate each photometric unit as an indi-vidual unit. Since each unit varies, they require its own calibration and conversion chart.
* Always check the calibration at the time of change of light source or whenever acciden-tal spillage of sample occurs in the chamber.
* Keep the unit clean and covered when not in use.
* Since spectrophotometry technique applies on the principle of colour estimation and its variation of the given solutions, it is always possible that the OD value of the cell suspen-sion varies with passage of time.
* Semen samples and suspension medium are to be maintained at equal temperature.

## Morphology

**Materials**
* Eosin Gentian

**Procedure**
1. Dilute semen in 500 ul buffer solution.
2. Smears were prepared by carefully dragging a drop of the fresh sperm across a degreased microscopic slide heated to 37°C.
3. The slides were allowed to air dry for a minimum of 2 h, and were then prepared and preserved in a 96 % ethanol solution during a 5-minute exposure.
4. After 30 min., the preserved slides were washed in distilled water, and then coloured with a 10 % aqueous solution of eosin during a 20- to 60-second exposure.
5. The coloured slides were washed in distilled water and coloured with gentian pigment during a 3- to 5-minute exposure.
6. After colouring, the slides were washed and dried.
7. The slides were gently rinsed with distilled water for 2 min. to remove debris. This procedure led to a clean background, and thus a good contrast against the stained.
