# Phenoloxidase

## Abstract
Phenoloxidase is highly immunologically active, generating a range of cytotoxins when switched on, so is generally stored as its inactive precursor prophenoloxidase. Phenoloxidase was measured as the total potential
phenoloxidase response (PO activity), measured after the artificial activation of propheno- loxidase into phenoloxidase with a-chymotrypsin, a common prophenoloxidase activator. Levels of PO activity were assayed through its catalysis of the conversion of L-dopa (3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylal- anine, colourless) to dopachrome (red-brown colour), measured photometrically

## Recipe
**NaCac**
1. 0.001 M sodium cacodylate
2. 0.005 M calcium chloride
3. pH=6.5

**PBS**
1. 150 mM NaCl
2. 10 mM Na2HPO4 3. pH=6.5

**α-chymotryposin**
1. 0.5 mg ml-1

**L-dopa (saturated, between 2.88 mM and 5.75 mM; solution filtered before use)**

**NB medium/liter**
1. 5g Nutrient Broth 
2. 2. 5g Bacto peptone 
3. 3. 10g NaCl

## Experimental Design

### Injections
1. Individuals were injections with 1μl of either PBS or E. coli 682 cells in PBS
    - For larval injections, 10^3 viable cells/μl of E. coli 682 in PBS was used
    - For adult injections, 10^5 viable cells/μl of E. coli 682 in PBS was used
Note: Dose-dependent preliminary studies reveal increase mortality rate with injections above the viable cells/μl listed above

2. Bacteria for injections were grown to an absorbance of A550=0.5 (~3 x10^8 cells/ml). After reaching appropriate, absorbance, the bacteria were:
   - Centrifuged (5200 RPM for 5 minutes)
    - The cells were washed twice and resuspended in PBS
    - The cells were then diluted to the desired PBS concentration
3. Glass microcapillary tubes were used for injections, whcih were produced with a micropippette pulleter(130μl diameter)
4. Before injections, the glass microcapillary tubes were dipped into a solution of 10μg/ml N-phenylthiorea, which prevents phenoloxidase activation at site of injection

### Hemolymph Extraction
1. Hemolymph extracts were collected and pooled from perfusion bleeds of 10 workers. 
2. The perfusion bleeds were done with 0.25 ml NaCac
3. Samples were immediately frozen (–80°C) for a minimum of 24 hours to disrupt the haemocytes. 
4. Prior to use, samples were defrosted and centrifuged (4°C, 8000 g, 15 min)

### Phenoloxidase Assay
1. Hemolymph samples were defrosted on ice, vortexed briefly to ensure thorough mixing, and centrifuged to re- move cell debris (4 °C, 80, 000G, 15 min)
2. 20μl of hemolymph aliquots were mixed with 135μl dH20, 20μl PBS and 5μl α-chymotryposin (0.5 mg ml-1) in pre-chilled 96-well plates.
3. The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature (19°C) for 5 min to allow activation, before adding 20 ml L-dopa
4. Recording started at 30°C in a spectrophotometer (VersaMax tunable microplate reader, Molecular Devices). Readings were taken at 490 nm every 15 seconds for 1 hour and analysed using Softmax Pro
v5.0.1 software.
5. Enzyme activity was measured as the maximum linear rate of substrate conversion.

### Inhibition-zone assay
1. An aliquot of 0.2ml of fresh overnight bacterial culture was spread onto agar plates (Ø 9cm) containing NB broth for the E.coli strain and LB broth for the M. Flavus strain. 
2. As soon as the bacterial layer was absorbed, 1.5 μl of undiluted hemoloymph samples were applied as a droplet onto a plate with a pipette tip.
3. After 24 hours of incubation at 37°C, the zone of inhibitions were documented and recorded.

2. The dorsal abdominal tergits of adult individuals were carefully removed and the melanised nodules were counted under a stereomicroscope.
3. Individuals were transferred onto a sheet of parafilm on top of a layer of paraffin and fixed dorsally with two needles. The ventral side was cut from the cranial to the caudal end (avoiding injury of the gut)
and the larval skins were then turned over and fixed with four additional needles before counting the visible nodules in the haemocoel

# Encapsulation response assay
## Materials
* Nylon monofilament 
* glycerol
* microscope slide

## Equipment
* Microscope 
* Image J software



## Procedure
1. A piece of nylon monofilament (0.2 9 2 mm) was then inserted ventrally through the intersegmental membrane into the abdomen, between the third and fourth sternites. The filament was cut at an angle, thus, producing a pointed end for ease of insertion.
2. The filaments were inserted approximately 1 mm into the abdomen, leaving 1 mm outside the body.
3. Treated workers were maintained in an incu bator for 24 h before freeze-killing.
4. Implanted filaments were extracted and placed in 50 % glycerol on a microscope slide. Each extracted filament was photo- graphed using a Zeiss Axiophot at 509 magnification, exposure time 924 ls. The images were analysed using ImageJ (National Institute of Health, USA) software to mea- sure themean grey value of the inserted section of the implant compared to that of a clear uninserted filament
