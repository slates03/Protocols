# Protocol for DNA extraction from single bees
## DAY 1: 

### A. Homogenization

0. Dual-label 5 1.5ml microtubes (with ID of bee) per bee that will be used. Record ID of bees onto the daily extraction log chart.

1. 	Store bee in 96% ethanol in the freezer. Remove the thorax used for extraction by decapitating bee with razor and then cutting off the abdomen (and keep parts ensuring identification); dry carefully on a paper towel. To avoid contamination, label bee IDs onto paper towel in a square where the bee will be dried. Cut the thorax in half and place one half into the labelled 1.5 ml microtubes (change razor every 5-6 bees). Each bee ID has its own designated row on the microtube rack. Make sure to always place bee samples in their corresponding row. Only one collected screw-topped tube and one sample tube are to be open at a given time.

2. 	Place a pestle into the tube and grind the tissue by crushing it against the side of the tube. When complete, make sure to always place bee samples in their corresponding row on the microtube rack.

3. 	Add 350 ul 2x CTAB to the tube and further homogenize the material, and then add another 350 ul 2x CTAB to rinse the pestle.

4. 	Add 4 uL RNAse A, incubate at room temperature for 2 minutes.

5. 	Add 10 ul Proteinase K (10 mg/ml dist. H20) and let the tissue digest for 2 h at 50o C in a water bath; gently stir occasionally.

### B. Extraction and purification

6. 	Briefly centrifuge the tubes; add 650 ul phenol-chloroform-isoamylalcohol (25:24:1), close the tubes, place them into a tube rack, cover them with a paper towel and shake the samples for 5 min thoroughly by hand (better mixing than by vortexing). All manipulations with phenol and chloroform must be achieved in the hood.

7. 	Centrifuge for 10 min at 13’200 rpm at RT. Carefully remove tubes from the centrifuge.

8. 	With a 10-200 ul pipette set to 200 ul, transfer as much as possible of the upper, aqueous layer (avoid the middle, white layer!) to a new tube. Avoid contamination by making sure that the liquid does not go into the pipette! Add 650 ul chloroform-isoamylalcohol (24:1) and shake the samples for 2-3 min by hand.

9. 	Centrifuge for 5 min at 13’200 rpm.

10.	Transfer as much as possible of the upper aqueous layer to a new tube, add 650 ul chloroform-isoamylalcohol (24:1) and mix thoroughly.

11.	Centrifuge for 5 min at 13’200 rpm. 

### C. DNA precipitation

12.	Transfer as much as possible of the upper, aqueous layer to a new tube; you should have approximately 400 ul; add 1000 ul (2.5 x the volume) ice cold (-20o C) ethanol (96%) and 40 ul (1/10 of the volume) 3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2); mix gently by inverting the tubes several times (10 - 20). Place the tubes into the freezer for the next day after ensuring the labels of the tubes have not been washed off by EtOH


## DAY 2: 

13.	Centrifuge for 30 min at 13’200 rpm at 4o C (pre-cool centrifuge for at least 15 min).

14.	Discard the liquid phase (carefully turn the tube on side opposite to the pellet, dry top of tube with a clean paper towel).

15.	Wash the pellet with 1000 ul ice cold (-20o C) ethanol (70%). Gently shake, do not vortex.

16.	Centrifuge for 10 min at 13’200 rpm at 4o C.

17.	Discard ethanol (carefully turn the tube on side opposite to the pellet and remove as much as you can by drying the tube on a clean paper towel). Ensure tube labels have not been washed off with EtOH.

18.	Dry the DNA pellet by leaving the tubes open 5-10 minutes at 50°C, ideally under the fume hood (a vacuum centrifuge can also be used). The pellet should not become totally dry, but ideally gelatinous (If necessary, leave tubes overnight at room temperature in fume hood).

19.	Add 50 ul dist. TE buffer, PH 8 (autoclaved).

20.	Do not vortex. Close tubes, let DNA dissolve for 5 minutes. 

21. 	Use Nanodrop spectrophotometer machine to measure quantity (ng/uL) and quality (260/280) of the sample and record results in the chart provided. 
22.    At this stage, you CAN clean the DNA with a Qiagen kit but you will lose sample


**Tips for DNA extraction from Qiagen**
1.	When using Qiagen kits, always elute twice
2.	Elute by pipetting directly on top of the silica filter in the Qiagen column. Avoid the raised edges inside the column
3.	Elute with hot (64 C) elution buffer
4.	Allow the hot elution buffer to sit on the Qiagen column for at least 2 minutes prior to spinning


**Protocol for DNA extraction from pooled bees: Mag-Bind**
5.	Take at least 20 nurses or returning foragers from each colony and flash freeze them
6.	Keep samples in labelled tubes in -80C until use
7.	Upon extraction, cut 20 worker thoraces into ¼ and place in a new tube
8.	 Use the Mag-Bind Blood DNA kit (Omega Biotek Store) with the manufacturer's recommended protocol to extract an average of 4.71±1.42 μg of high-quality DNA from each of the colonies.


**Protocol for DNA extraction from pooled bees: Proposed**
9.	Take at least 20 nurses or returning foragers from each colony and flash freeze them
10.	Keep samples in labelled tubes in -80C until use
11.	Upon extraction, take 50 worker thoraces and place in a sturdy plastic bag with enough CTAB for the number of bees in the sample. 
12.	Crush the bag and fully homogenize it 
13.	Follow protocol above for Phenol-extraction
