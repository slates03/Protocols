# RNA Extraction

## Materials
* 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes
* Blue pestils or microcentrifuge tubes with Droconum oxide beads TriZol
* BCP(1-Bromo-3-Chloropentane)
* Isopropyl Alcohol
* 75% ethanol
* 100% ethanol

## Procedure

1. Homogenize samples in 500μl TriZol within 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes
    * Note: Samples can be homogenized with either a blue pestil or a bullet blender using Droconium oxide beads
2. Add additional 500μl TriZol to homogenized sample Additional Step- To clean up sample
    * Centrifuge samples at 12,000g for 10 minutes at 4°C to remove particulate 
    * Decant supernatant (~850μl) to new RNase free 1.5mL tubes
        * Note: do not touch particulate
3. Samples can noe be kept at -80°C for up to one month before processing

## Phase Seperation
1. Add 100μl (100μl/ml TriZol) of BCP(1-Bromo-3-Chloropentane) to the samples in the tri-reagant
2. Shake vigourously for 15 seconds
3. Incubate for 5-10 minutes at room temperature
4. Centrifuge at 12,000g for 8 minutes at 4°C
      * Following centrifuging, the mixture separates into a lower red phenol phase, interphase, and colorless aqueous phase(RNA). RNA remains exclusively in the aqueous phase, while DNA and proteins are in the interphase and organic phase
      
## RNA Precipitation
1. Transfer aqueous phase (~375μl) into RNase free 1.5mL microcentrifuge tubes
      * Be very careful to not touch the cloudy layer(Be very conservative because 375μl is not needed) If layer is disturbed, repeat previous centrifugation step
2. Add 500μl of isopropyl alcohol to the aqueous phase
      * This allows the RNA to be precipitated from the aqueous phase
3. Invert samples to mix
4. Incubate at room temperature for 2-10 minutes
5. Centrifuge at 12,000g for 8 minutes at 4°C
6. White/clear pellet should now be visible

## RNA Wash
1. Remove supernatant
2. Wash RNA with 1000μl of 75% ethanol and vortex lightly
      * Vortex just enough to dislodge pellet from side of tube 
3. Centrifuge at 7,500 RPM for 5 minutes at 4°C
      * If RNA pellet accumulates on the side of tge tube, or floats, sediment the pellet by spinning at 12,000g for 5 minutes at 4°C

## RNA Storing
1. Remove the 75% ethanol wash by using p1000 pipet
      * Collect by centrifugation at remove remainder of EtOH with p200 pipet 
      * Be careful not to disturb pellet
2. Added 1000μl of 100% ethanol
3. Stored in -80°C freezer until ready for cDNA

## Quigen Cleaning
1. Add RNA in 100% ETOH to column
2. Add to Quiagen RNEASY column
3. 500ul RW1, spin @7800 for 15 seconds (15 second spin = 15ss)
4. Add 10ul DNASE into 70ul RDD then add this 80ul to the column. Ensure complete coverage of the filter and edges. Note: make a master batch if doing large numbers of samples
5. Incubate for 15 minutes @RT
6. Add 350 ul RW1 15ss, remove flow through
7. Add 500ul RPE 15ss, remove flow through
8. Add 500ul RPE 15ss, remove flow through
9. Dry the sample completely (15ss)
10. Add new tube to bottom and add 30-50ul warm DEPC-treated H2O. Let sit for a few minutes then 15ss
